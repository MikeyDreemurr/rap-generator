I am the stone that the builder refused
The individual, the inspiration
That made ladies sing the blues

I'm the spark that makes your idea bright
The same spark that likes the dark
So that you can know your left from your right

I am the ballot in your box, the bullet in the gun, the inner glow that lets you know,
the car that brought your son...
the story that just begun, the promise of what's to come
And i'mma remain a soldier till the war is won


Babe if you let me, you know I could get deep
Baby hope you ready, I’m coming through, running you
That’s what I do, just know that it’s all for you
So what you gonna choose? Afraid to say "okay"

And I know I’m not gonna get in the way
But I’m afraid, who I wanna be is what I became
But I’m ashamed, ain’t no coming back, facing what I wanted...
